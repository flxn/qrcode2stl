  printGuideSubtitle: 'How to print a dual color QR code with a single extruder 3d printer?',
  printGuideWIPInfo: 'This guide is a work in progress.',
  printGuideIntro: `
  You can print multi colored objects even with a single extruder by swapping the filament at specific layers.<br/>
  We can use this method to print the base of our QR code and the actual QR code part on the top in two different colors.<br/>
  This technique is what makes 3d printable QR codes possible in the first place.<br/>
  The process is different depending on the slicer software you are using.<br/>
  In this guide I will focus on Cura and PrusaSlicer only and I am taking no responsibility whatsoever if you somehow damage your printer in the process.<br/>`,
  printGuideSupportWarningTitle: 'Keep in mind: Not all printers/firmwares support the necessary functionality!',
  printGuideSupportWarningMessage: `
  This is meant as a general guide, as I can't provide a writeup on every printer/firmware combination out there.<br/>
  I recommend doing a small test print first. If you are having problems getting this to work, please search online if your specific printer model supports the <strong>M600</strong> G-Code command for filament changing.<br/>`,
  printGuideGenerateQRCode: 'Generating the QR code',
  printGuideGenerateQRCodeSteps: `
  <li>Select the type of QR code you want to generate under "QR Code Options".</li>
  <li>Fill out the necessary fields.</li>
  <li>Configure the 3d model under "3D Model Options".</li>
  <li>Click on "Generate 3D Model"</li>
  <li>Save the stl file via the "Save As STL" button in the top right.</li>`,
  printGuideVersionDisclaimer: 'Version {version}, your experience can differ.',
  // Cura
  printGuideCuraStep1: `
  Slice the model and locate the layer where the color change should happen.<br/>
  In my case this is at layer 16.<br/>`,
  printGuideCuraStep2: `
  <li>Go to "Extensions -> Post Processing -> Modify G-Code".</li>
  <li>Click on "Add a script" then select "Filament Change".</li>
  <li>In the Filament Change settings, set the "Layer" value to your layer number from step 1.</li>
  <li>Re-Slice your model. The icon left of the "Slice" button indicates an active Post Processing script.</li>`,
  // PrusaSlicer
  printGuidePrusaSlicerStep1: `
  Slice the model and locate the layer where the color change should happen.<br/>
  In my case this is at layer 11.<br/>`,
  printGuidePrusaSlicerStep2: `
  <li>Click on the little plus sign right of the layer selection bar.</li>
  <li>PrusaSlicer gives you a nice preview where you can see the different colors to verify that you selected the right layer. The qr code parts should have a different color than the base</li>
  <li>Re-Slice your model.</li>`,
  printGuideStep3: `
  You can now print the model as usual.<br/>
  The 3d printer will pause on the specified layer and move to the origin of the print bed.
  Now you can swap the filament and restart the print job from your printers menu.`,

  // FAQ Section
  //
  faqTitle: 'Frequently Asked Questions',
  faqQuestion1: 'What file formats can I export?',
  faqAnswer1: 'You can export your 3D models as STL files (both binary and ASCII formats) for 3D printing, or as PNG images for previewing.',
  faqQuestion2: 'What\'s the difference between error correction levels?',
  faqAnswer2: 'Higher error correction levels make the QR code more resistant to damage and scanning errors, but also make the code denser with more modules. For 3D printing, Medium (M) or Quartile (Q) levels usually work best.',
  faqQuestion3: 'Why does my QR code not scan properly after printing?',
  faqAnswer3: 'Make sure there\'s enough contrast between the QR code modules and the base. Use different colored filaments or ensure the height difference is significant enough. Also check that your printer\'s resolution is sufficient for the QR code size.',
  faqQuestion4: 'Will my QR Code keep working forever or does it expire?',
  faqAnswer4: 'The generated QR code itself will continue to work forever. However, if you\'re using the QR code to link to an external page, the link may break over time. This is out of our control. If it\'s a page you own, make sure the link stays online. If it\'s a third-party page and they update their site, the link may stop working. You can use a URL shortener that allows you to change the destination link after creation. Spotify codes will work until Spotify discontinues this feature.',
  faqQuestion5: 'How can I print QR codes with my multicolor 3D printer?',
  faqAnswer5: 'When exporting the QR code, select the option to download the 3D model in multiple parts. This option is located at the top of the page, directly to the left of the STL export button. This creates a zip file containing all the different parts of the 3D model. Load all parts into your slicer and overlay them on top of each other. Now you can assign colors to the different parts in your slicer. You can also create a 2D-looking printed QR code by setting the height value of your QR code to a very low setting (e.g., 0.1mm). Please check the preview in your slicer to ensure everything works as expected.',
